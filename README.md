express-crash
=============

Crash handling for express.


## Why?

Handling 404 & 500 errors in any web app is certainly a must-do. While this is an easy, but mandatory and not so fun task, this module comes in handy.


## I surely don't handle any error yet, how do I install it?

Easily:
```bash
npm install express-crash
```


## OK, quickly, how does it work?

It helps to setup standard express error handlers. There are 2 important things to understand:

* The module provides a `NotFoundError` enabling choosing between 404 and 500 errors. So whenever you want a 404, you can pass a `NotFoundError` to the next route handler.
* The module uses a catch 'em all route in order to emit a 404 if no route did match.


## How shall I set it up?

There are two ways of using it:

* Set things separately, one by one.
* Use the shortcut method `handle()` and give it your 404 and 500 handlers. It will do the rest.

In both case, make sure you carefully use `trapRoute()` after your actual routes as it will match anything in order to throw a not found error.


```js
// mandatory step: require the module
var crash = require('express-crash');

var handle404 = function(err, req, res, next) {
	// do something fancy to entertain the users
};
var handle500 = function(err, req, res, next) {
	// do something even more fancy to thrill the users
};

// manual handler setup
// trapRoute() sets the catch 'em all route, so be sure it comes after your actual handlers
app.use(crash.handle404(handle404));
app.use(crash.handle500(handle500));
crash.trapRoute(app);

// quick 'n easy way to set handlers
crash.handle(app, handle404, handle500);
```


## Dude, did you test anything?

Sure! Just install with dev deps:

```bash
npm install -d
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
make test
```
